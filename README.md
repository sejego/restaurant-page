# Restaurant Page

## Description

This is a JS project done as a part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/javascript-restaurant-page).
All elements of DOM are created in JS. The webpack handles all the styles, JS modules and images. The idea of an app was to make all parts of DOM in JS only and make the code modular.
